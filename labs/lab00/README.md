# lab00: Setup lab environment

## 1.Description
**In this lab, we will build our own penetration test environment using Kali Linux and Windows server 2019**

* Install  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your own PC or laptop. The physical computer you use is called a "Host". The virtual machines that run on it are called "Guests". 
* Create a NAT network and attach all VMs to it.
* Create a virtual machine for Kali Linux
* Create a virtual machine for Windows server 2019


**Prerequisite:**

Your PC must support virtualization which is popular today, following the section 'Check virtualization availability' in the reference to find its availability and enable it.

* Your own PC or laptop needs more than 100GB free space for these VMs
* If you don't have sufficient free space, you may buy an external USB **3.0+** Flash drive or SSD, for example
  * _USB 3.0+ Flash drive_
    * [Samsung BAR Plus 256GB - 300MB/s USB 3.1 Flash Drive Titan Gray (MUF-256BE4/AM)](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-BAR-Plus-32GB-MUF-32BE4/dp/B07BPKL2D2?ref\_=fsclp\_pl\_dp\_2&th=1)
    * [SanDisk 256GB Extreme PRO USB 3.1 Solid State Flash Drive - SDCZ880-256G-G46](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7QDO7M/ref=emc\_b\_5\_t)
  * _USB 3.0+  External SSD_
    * [SanDisk 500GB Extreme Portable External SSD - Up to 550MB/s - USB-C, USB 3.1 - SDSSDE60-500G-G25](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-500GB-Extreme-Portable-External/dp/B078SWJ3CF/ref=sr\_1\_1?dchild=1&keywords=SanDisk\+500GB\+Extreme\+Portable\+External\+SSD\+-\+Up\+to\+550MB%2Fs\+-\+USB-C%2C\+USB\+3\.1\+-\+SDSSDE60-500G-G25&qid=1588950864&s=electronics&sr=1-1)
    * [Samsung (MU-PA500B/AM)T5 Portable SSD - 500GB - USB 3.1 External SSD , Blue ](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-T5-Portable-SSD-MU-PA500B/dp/B073GZBT36?ref\_=fsclp\_pl\_dp\_3&th=1)

## 2.Steps
1. (20%, 10% for each VM) Create two virtual machines, one for Kali Linux, the other for Windows server
   * NAT network settings:
     * Create a NAT network in VirtualBox
   * VM settings:
     * *2GB memory* (Your laptop needs at least 8GB memory)
     * Connect to the NAT network
     * Enable network promiscuous mode

2. (25%)Install Kali Linux
Follow the steps below to setup Kali Linux in its VM:

   * (5%) Go to its official webset [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/), download its 64-bit Virtual machine in VirtualBox format.
   * (20%) Follow its [documentation](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/import-premade-virtualbox/) add this VM into VirtualBox.


1. (25%)Install Windows server

   * (5%)Download [Windows Server 2019 VHD](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019)
   * (20%)Create a VM and import this Windows server

   * Extending the Trial Period (If you have an old one)
     In Powershell, execute this command to see how many days you have left in your trial:

     slmgr -dlv

     Execute this command to extend the trial for another 180 days:

     slmgr -rearm

     You can extend the trial six times, for up to three years.

2. (30%) Show the NAT network is working
	 * On the Windows Server VM, find its ip configuration of the Ethernet adapter connected to the NAT: 	ipconfig /all
	 * On the Kali Linux VM, find its ip configuration of the Ethernet adapter connected to the NAT: 	ifconfig -a
	 * from the Windows server VM ping the Kali VM
	 * from the Kali VM ping the Windows server VM




*Optional*

After installation, *make sure you can access Internet*, update and upgrade Kali, then install the following tools. Open a terminal window, run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. populate the repository
# use a text editor open /etc/apt/sources.list with sudo then add the following two lines if there are not there
deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
deb-src http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free
# 2. update, upgrade Kali then install several popular tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr
sudo apt install p7zip-full build-essential gcc perl cmake automake curl git geany okular vim
```

* Install [VirtualBox Guest Additions in the guest Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-additions/).
